###Challenge
Discussing Kickstarter Campaigns focused on outcomes based on goals reveals to unique observations: 1)The a success rate  declines as you approach 15k and failure picks up at around 10k. This could be due to a lack of a sweet spot once a certain dollar requirment is demanded in order for success to be achieved. 2) The goals enter into a very strong, choppy phase as you enter in the 25k t 50k+ as there is less stability in success or failure outcomes. Concerning Launch date observations, the evidence seems to present that launch dates spike around May/June and fall over time. This may be due to Summer activity, especially with summer and an active society due to lax work hours and children out of school.
