Discussing Kickstarter Campaigns focused on outcomes based on goals reveals three unique observations: 1)The success rate  declines as you approach 15k and failures pick up at around 10k. This could be due to a lack of a sweet spot once a certain dollar requirment is demanded in order for success to be achieved. 2) The goals enter into a very strong, choppy phase as you enter in the 25k t 50k+ as there is less stability in success or failure outcomes. 3) Unfortunately one visible limitation to the data set is a breakdown of how many individuals contributed to the success which may show further illustrate enthusiasm as another key driver of success. If you have a 2.5k kickstarter which 100 contributors, you could say enthsiasm was a strong key driver in success.


Concerning Launch date observations, the evidence seems to present that launch dates spike around May/June and fall over time. This may be due to Summer activity, especially with summer and an active society due to lax work hours and children out of school. Furthermore, there may be a cyclical success and failure rate due to key demographics and regional locations. You could dig further into socio economic branches and see if regional areas are predisposed to certain Theater showings. The data lacks how a launch was executed as even if everone launches around the same quarter or April, May, June there may be key details as to how the launch was executed and the circumstances again around enthusiams and the total number of attendees who helps launch a campaign.
