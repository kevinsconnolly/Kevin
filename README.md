###Challenge

Update and fine tune VBA Code for more efficient data pull.

For this assignment, we were given a piece of VBA code with the instruciton to "rework the code in order to be more efficient" with the goal of making the code saving time and frustration. There are a few key updates to the code in order to ensure a "more efficient" piece of VBA. 
  1) Total volume and tickers index set to zero
  2) Added tickersindex which helped maintain the key data to the respective stock symbol
    a) This helped ensure a more efficient piece of code to store all the data for the stock symbol by effectively increasing the total        volume by the value (stock symbol) in the current row.

Discussing Kickstarter Campaigns focused on "outcomes based on goals" reveals three unique observations: 1)The success rate  declines as you approach 15k and failures pick up at around 10k ie 'divergence'. This could be due to a lack of a sweet spot once a certain dollar requirment is demanded in order for success to be achieved. 2) The goals enter into a very strong, choppy phase as you enter in the 25k to 50k+ as there is less stability in success or failure outcomes. 3) Unfortunately one visible limitation to the data set is a breakdown of how many individuals contributed to the success which may further illustrate enthusiasm as another key driver of success. If you have a 2.5k kickstarter with 100 contributors, you could say enthsiasm was a strong key driver in success. On another note, a very few rabid, enthused individuals could contribute 1k each to a 5k goal and have success as well. So dollars and size groups don't necessarily translate into success.


Concerning "Launch date observations", the evidence seems to present that launch dates spike around May/June and deckine over time. This may be due to Summer activity, especially with warm weather and an active society due to lax work hours and children out of school. Furthermore, there may be a cyclical success and failure rate due to key demographics and regional locations. You could dig further into socio economic branches and see if regional areas are predisposed to certain Theater showings. The data lacks how a launch was executed as even if everyone launches around the same quarter or April, May, June there may be key details as to how the launch was executed and the circumstances again around enthusiasms and not just dollar contributors but "soft dollar" or "boots on the ground" word of mouth individuals whose hard work could actually be a better contributor to success. Preparation is one key indicator which I would like to see due to the fact preparation is why so many endeavours succeed or fail. As an example, let's say you started Shakespeare's 'midsommer night dreams' campaign planned for April practice and June stage act, you may not afford enough time for the theatre and may actually fail on time preparation. This fail in preparation may actually lead to poor performance and showing, leading to a decay in attendance and ultimate failure; where as if you start planning for 'Scrooge' in May for a December showing you may have a lot better chance at launch due to time to practice. But unfortunately, a winter play may drive strong enthusiasm in December due to winter which draws individuals for nostalgic reasons which lessons the case to be made for launch date success due to time but mostly lining up plays during annual seasons.
