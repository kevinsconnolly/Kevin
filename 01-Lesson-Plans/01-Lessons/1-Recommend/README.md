# Module 1: Virtual Class (Recommended) (2hr)

## Instructor Prep

<details>
    <summary><strong>What Are Virtual Class (Recommended) Sessions?</strong></summary>

Virtual Class (Recommended) Sessions are held earlier in the week (Mondays/Tuesdays) and are optional for students. The primary goals of Recommended Sessions are:

1. Build community
2. Help students who are “stuck” on the asynchronous work
3. Provide extra context in the learning journey such as remedial practice, career prep, etc.

Virtual Class (Recommended) Sessions are designed to be flexible in many ways, from student attendance requirements to the Instructor Lesson Plans. As you get to know your students, you should adjust the activities you do and organization of the time to best meet their needs. Each session, however, should incorporate an “office hours” component in which you and your supporting instructional staff can assist students with their individual issues (either in group or in 1:1 breakout groups).

    <summary><strong>Preparing for Your First Virtual Class (Recommended) Session</strong></summary>

We find it particularly valuable to start your first session off with a consistent structure meant to help build the learning community, relax early class jitters, and establish yourself as the expert. Building this foundation in the first Virtual Class (Recommended) Session will pay dividends down the road.

1. Review the recommended activities below and prepare your plan
2. Morning of the session, post a quick “looking forward” message and agenda on your specific `01-live` Slack channel; invite students to submit questions ahead of time
3. Log into the session at the class time by going to your course in Canvas, clicking Zoom, and then clicking the meeting link.

    <summary><strong>First Virtual Class (Recommended) Session Agenda</strong></summary>

The following is a recommended agenda for the session. Times are very rough estimates and will depend on how the conversation is going. Feel free to adjust as you get familiar with the class. However, we recommend doing the organized activities before finishing with the “Office Hours” piece so that students who don’t need that extra assistance can hop off. As well, if the “Office Hours” portion runs out before end of class time, it’s okay to end a bit early.

## Agenda

### Part 1: Instructor Introduction / AMA

| Estimated Time: 0:20-0:30 |  
|---------------------------|

<details>
    <summary><strong>🥅 Goals</strong></summary>

- Build credibility / expertise
- Excite students about industry
- Settle nerves (students are typically worried here about whether they fit in so establishing big picture is helpful)

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>🏒 Tasks</strong></summary>

- Start off the session by talking about your background, your professional journey, tools you work with that are also a part of this curriculum, and cool accomplishments/projects you’ve completed
- Set the industry context. Possible topics could include growth of the industry, big players, emerging trends, etc. This is also a good time to establish the differences and similarities between Data Science, Data Visualization and Data Analytics and how it pertains to the entire scope of the course
- Consider opening up to Ask Me Anything (AMA)

</details>

### Part 2: Introductions

| Estimated Time: 0:15-0:20 |  
|---------------------------|

<details>
    <summary><strong>🥅 Goals</strong></summary>

- Students start to build community
- Students are active

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>🏒 Tasks</strong></summary>

- Quick student introductions around the room. May simply include name, location, professional background, course goals (if group is very large, could make the ask smaller here for time)
- Consider going deeper with a “speed dating” style random breakout room activity to follow. To do this, simply click Breakout Rooms in Zoom and automatically assign small groups (3-5 people inc. TAs), give them 1-2 questions to discuss (e.g., when and where will you be studying? Topic most excited about?), after a few minutes, pull everyone back, reassign to rooms (new question if desired). Repeat a few times so students have had an opportunity to small group with several of their peers.

### Part 3: AirBnb Activity

| Estimated Time: 0:15-0:20 |  
|---------------------------|

<details>
    <summary><strong>🥅 Goals</strong></summary>

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>🏒 Tasks</strong></summary>

- Do a quick "5-point" poll - Ask on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 meaning no experience to 5 being mastery, their comfort with Excel. Consider sharing anonymous results with class. 
- Share the [AirBnB Example](./assets/airbnb-assignment.pdf) with students as an example of a real-world task they can expect to see in interviews. Let students know that they will be able to accomplish tasks similar to this by the end of the course. For each section of the example assignment, talk specifically about which parts of the course will help them accomplish that part of the given task.
